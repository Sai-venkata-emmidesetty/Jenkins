question :
-----------

Can we have a jenkins agent which is a docker container and run our test inside the docker container?

answer: Yes, you can absolutely use a Docker container as a Jenkins agent to run your tests.
---------

1) This is used for isolation of the pipeline steps
2)Here the code is expected to run inside a docker container which can use a custom test image if required
3)This is the best way to perform testing without having every Jenkins agent needing to have packages installed

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
--------------------------------------------
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'node:16.13.1-alpine' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}

------------------------------------------------end--------------------------------

agent {
    docker { image 'node:16.13.1-alpine' }
}

This block specifies the agent or executor that will run the pipeline.
In this case, a Docker container with the image node:16.13.1-alpine is used. 
This image provides a Node.js environment for running the script.
*******************************************************************************
Stages Definition:

stages {
    stage('Test') {
        // ...
    }
}

This block defines a stage named 'Test'. Stages are used to group steps logically.
********************************************************************************
4. Stage Steps:

Groovy
steps {
    sh 'node --version'
}


This block contains the steps to be executed within the 'Test' stage.
The sh step executes a shell command.
Here, node --version is executed to print the Node.js version installed in the Docker container.
*****************************************************************************************
In summary:

A Jenkins pipeline is created.
A Docker container with Node.js 16.13.1 is used as the execution environment.
A stage named 'Test' is defined.
Within the 'Test' stage, the node --version command is executed to check the Node.js version.
Key Points:

Docker Container: The Docker container provides a clean and isolated environment for running the script.
Node.js Version: The node:16.13.1-alpine image ensures that the specific version of Node.js is available.
Shell Command: The sh step allows you to execute shell commands within the pipeline.
